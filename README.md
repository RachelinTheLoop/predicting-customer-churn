# Customer Churn Prediction: Data-Driven Insights for Proactive Retention


### Author : Rachel Odhiambo

## Introduction
Customer churn, also called customer attrition, refers to when users **stop doing business** with a company. In the telecom industry, this is when a subscriber **discontinues their mobile, internet, or voice service**, either by switching to a competitor or dropping service altogether.
In today's **hyper-competitive telecom market**, where customer acquisition costs are rising, **retaining existing customers** has become a **strategic necessity**.

### Why It Matters
- Acquiring new users costs **5–7× more** than retention.
- A **5% retention increase** can boost profits by **25–95%**.
- Churn rates average **1–3%**, and can exceed **6%** in emerging markets,causing major revenue loss.

### Real-World Cases
- **Vodafone UK** lost 500K users due to billing issues → adopted AI-based churn prediction.
- **MTN Nigeria** used ML to trigger automated SMS/app retention messages.
- **Safaricom (Kenya)** launched micro-campaigns to retain Gen Z users lost to Airtel.


In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. .


## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict customer churn using the **SyriaTel Telecom** dataset. It includes thorough data exploration, model experimentation, and final recommendations to help stakeholders reduce churn and improve retention.

## Business Understanding

### Real-World Applications of Customer Churn Prediction

**Telecommunications**  
Just like SyriaTel, companies such as Safaricom, Airtel, and Telkom Kenya can use churn models to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies (e.g., discounts, loyalty rewards).

**Banking & Fintech**  
Apps like M-Pesa, KCB App, and Tala can use churn prediction to keep users active by offering incentives before they switch to competitors.

**Subscription Services**  
Netflix and Spotify use similar models to understand when users are likely to cancel subscriptions, then act proactively by sending personalized content or offers.

**E-commerce & Retail**  
Jumia and Amazon can apply churn models to predict when frequent customers are about to leave and respond with promo codes, personalized suggestions, or improved user experience.

**Ride-Hailing**  
Companies like Bolt and Uber can track user inactivity and re-engage riders or drivers through churn prediction strategies and retention campaigns.



## Stakeholders and Business Value

This project provides valuable insights that can directly support strategic decisions across departments:

**Customer Service Team**  
Can proactively reach out to customers flagged as high churn risk and provide personalized support or solutions to improve satisfaction.

**Marketing Department**

## About the Data

This project uses the **SyriaTel Customer Churn dataset**, which simulates real-world telecom customer behavior to predict churn.

###  Dataset Summary

1. **Source**: [Kaggle – Churn in Telecoms Dataset]
2. **Records**: 3,333 customers  
3. **Target Variable**: `Churn` – Indicates whether a customer left (`Yes`) or stayed (`No`)  
4. **Features**: Customer demographics, account details (e.g., total minutes, charges, customer service calls), and services subscribed.

### Preprocessing Steps

1. Handled outliers and dropped columns with high cardinality 
2. Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
3. Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
4. Applied SMOTE to balance the classes (`Churn`: Yes vs No)

### Limitations

1. **Class Imbalance** – Majority of customers did not churn  
2. **No Time-Series Data** – Limits behavioral trend analysis  
3. **Synthetic Dataset** – Based on simulated data



##  Tools Used

This project was completed using the following tools and technologies:

1. **Python** – Main programming language for data analysis and modeling  
2. **Pandas** – For data loading, exploration, and manipulation  
3. **NumPy** – For numerical operations and array handling  
4. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – For data visualization and exploratory analysis  
5. **Scikit-learn** – For machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics  
6. **XGBoost** – For gradient boosting and high-performance classification  
7. **SMOTE** (from `imblearn`) – For handling class imbalance  
8. **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive development and documentation  
9. **Git** & **GitHub** – For version control and project collaboration

## Analysis Approach

The project followed a structured data science process:

1. **Problem Definition** – Defined the goal of predicting customer churn to reduce revenue loss.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Explored churn patterns based on service usage, call behavior, and subscription plans.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, scaled features, and applied SMOTE for class balance.
4. **Feature Analysis** – Focused on churn by customer service calls, voicemail plan, international plan, number of calls, and state.
5. **Modeling** – Trained multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
6. **Evaluation** – Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
7. **Insights & Recommendations** – Interpreted results to suggest targeted retention strategies.


## Insights & Visual Analysis

To better understand the drivers of churn, several key factors were analyzed. The findings were visualized to reveal patterns and behaviors linked to higher churn rates.

### Key Churn Insights:

- **Customer Service Calls**: Higher churn observed among customers who contacted customer service frequently.
- **Voice Mail Plan**: Customers without a voicemail plan showed slightly higher churn tendencies.
- **Total Calls vs. Churn**: Explored how overall call volume relates to churn rate.
